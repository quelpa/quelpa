## Overview

`quelpa` uses recipes in [MELPA's format](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa#recipe-format) to build your desired packages from source and installs them using the built-in Emacs package manager. Basically, it's a standards-complying [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get). Or a local MELPA that doesn't require waiting for new builds.

`quelpa` can be used in many ways, for example to manage your personal packages with less limitations than a package archive would impose on you, testing development versions of other packages or as a helper when developing a package.

To get an idea how to use it to manage your Emacs setup, take a look at the [steckemacs configuration](https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs.el/blob/master/steckemacs.el), where `quelpa` loads and installs the required packages just before they are configured.

You can build and install packages from all the sources MELPA's build script `package-build` supports: Git, Github, Bazaar (bzr), Mercurial (hg), Subversion (svn), CVS, Darcs, Emacs Wiki (wiki)

## Requirements

-   Emacs 24.3.1
-   git: <http://git-scm.com/>

Every build requires the corresponding build tool. To install a `subversion` hosted package, you need to have `subversion` installed.

Note: Even if the sources of a package are fetched with a VCS tool you have installed, they might have dependencies that require a different VCS tool. Better install the most common ones before proceeding.

## Installation

First `quelpa` needs to be bootstrapped. This means MELPA's `package-build` has to be installed first, then `quelpa` itself.

To bootstrap `quelpa` use this code snippet:

```cl
(package-initialize)
(if (require 'quelpa nil t)
    (quelpa-self-upgrade)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (url-insert-file-contents "https://raw.github.com/quelpa/quelpa/master/bootstrap.el")
    (eval-buffer)))
```

Evaluate this expression in your `*scratch*` buffer to bootstrap `quelpa`. Add it to your Emacs init file to make sure `quelpa` will be installed and upgraded automatically when needed.

If you don't like `quelpa` doing self-upgrades (although this is recommended), use the following snippet instead:

```cl
(package-initialize)
(unless (require 'quelpa nil t)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (url-insert-file-contents "https://raw.github.com/quelpa/quelpa/master/bootstrap.el")
    (eval-buffer)))
```

**Note**: `(package-initialize)` can be omitted if you are already running the command before the snippet in your init file.

To setup Emacs on Microsoft Windows so that it works with `quelpa` is a bit tricky so we have added some [Instructions for Windows](#windows-instructions). Please consider them before trying to use `quelpa` on Windows.

## Usage

Cool. Now that we are all setup, enjoy the ride.

There are two ways to install packages with `quelpa`:

### Installing with a package name

Check <http://melpa.milkbox.net/> for any packages you would like to install. You only need to know the name:

```cl
(quelpa 'magit)
```

Running this expression will fetch the `magit` source code from Github, build a package in the ELPA format and install it.

Interactive installation is supported as well. Just execute `M-x quelpa` and select a recipe name from MELPA.

If the package has dependencies they will be installed first.

### Installing with a recipe

You can also install packages that are not on MELPA. For this you need to provide a recipe in MELPA's format.

For example if I'd like to install the [eval-sexp-fu.el package](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/eval-sexp-fu.el) which is located on the Emacs Wiki but not available on MELPA, I just need to provide a valid recipe instead of a package name:

```cl
(quelpa '(eval-sexp-fu :fetcher wiki :files ("eval-sexp-fu.el")))
```

Don't forget the quote before the recipe.

### Upgrading individual packages

Per default `quelpa` does not do anything if a package is already installed. You can customize this behavior globally by setting the variable `quelpa-upgrade-p` to `t` manually:

```cl
(setq quelpa-upgrade-p t)
```

Alternatively customize this variable by executing `M-x customize-variable quelpa-upgrade-p RET`.

It is also possible to override this default behavior for individual packages:

#### Interactive Overriding

When `quelpa` is called interactively with a prefix argument (e.g `C-u M-x quelpa`) it will try to upgrade the given package even if the global variable `quelpa-upgrade-p` is set to nil.

That means `C-u M-x quelpa magit RET` will upgrade magit.

Please note that the `:upgrade` parameter described below is still preferred over the prefix argument.

#### Non-Interactive Overriding

```cl
(quelpa 'company :upgrade t)
```

This way `quelpa` will try to upgrade `company` even if upgrading is disabled globally.

```cl
(quelpa '(ag :repo "Wilfred/ag.el" :fetcher github) :upgrade nil)
```

When used that way, `quelpa` will not upgrade `ag`. This can be used to "pin" packages when evaluating a buffer with `quelpa` invocations.

### Upgrading all packages

Upgrading all your `quelpa` packages at init is one option to keep them up to date, but can slow it down considerably. Alternatively you can execute `M-x quelpa-upgrade` and upgrade every cached package.

This command relies on an intact cache file which is set in the `quelpa-cache-file` variable. It is updated after every `quelpa` invocation. To reset it for debugging purposes, just delete the file and better keep a backup.

### Stable packages

`quelpa` can be instructed to build stable packages. This means that the repository with the source code (`git` or `hg` are supported) is queried for a stable tag and if one is found that version will be built.

For more information please see [MELPA's notes on stable packages](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa#stable-packages).

In `quelpa` there is a global variable where building of stable packages can be enabled, so that all packages are built stable (if available for the individual package):

```cl
(setq quelpa-stable-p t)
```

or you can set it just for one package by supplying `stable` as an argument:

```cl
(quelpa 'anzu :stable t)
```

or as part of the recipe itself:

```cl
(quelpa '(ag :repo "Wilfred/ag.el" :fetcher github :stable t))
```

The definition as part of the recipe has the highest priority and overrides the other two methods. Likewise adding it as an argument overrides the global variable. So the priority is like: recipe > argument > `quelpa-stable-p`.

Note that dev version numbers are usually higher than stable version numbers (they are using the build date as version) so if you want to install a stable version for an installed dev package you will first have to uninstall that package.

### Managing packages

Because `quelpa` installs packages using the built-in Emacs package management system, you can use its regular interface by executing `M-x list-packages` and work with your packages as you would normally do. Deleting a package does not affect the `quelpa` cache yet.

Currently `quelpa` does not remove obsolete packages after upgrades. To delete all obsolete packages from time to time use: 

-   `M-x list-packages RET`
-   press  `~` to mark all obsolete packages for deletion
-   press `x` and confirm deletion

### use-package handler

If you are using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) (which can help to simplify your .emacs) you can use the `quelpa` handler provided by `quelpa-use-package.el`.

Assuming you have bootstrapped `quelpa` and installed `use-package` probably like this:

```cl
(quelpa '(use-package :fetcher github :repo "jwiegley/use-package" :files ("use-package.el")))
```

To use the `:quelpa` keyword with `use-package`, require the library:

```cl
(require 'quelpa-use-package)
```

then it's possible to call `use-package` with all kinds of arguments:

```cl
(use-package abc-mode :quelpa) ;installs abc-mode with quelpa
(use-package abc-mode :quelpa t) ;does the same
(use-package abc-mode :quelpa abc-mode) ;again... (if the package would have another name)
(use-package abc-mode :quelpa (:upgrade t)) ;passes upgrade parameter to quelpa
(use-package abc-mode :quelpa (abc-mode :fetcher github :repo "mkjunker/abc-mode")) ;uses recipe
(use-package abc-mode :quelpa ((abc-mode :fetcher github :repo "mkjunker/abc-mode") :upgrade t)) ;recipe with plist arguments
```

### Additional fetchers

One fetcher has been added to build packages from single `.el` files. It works like this:

```cl
(quelpa '(rainbow-mode :url "http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/elpa.git/plain/packages/rainbow-mode/rainbow-mode.el" :fetcher url))
```

You specify the `:url` (either a remote or local one like `file:///path/to/file.el`) of the file and as `:fetcher` `url`.

Another example:


```cl
(quelpa '(ox-rss :url "http://orgmode.org/cgit.cgi/org-mode.git/plain/contrib/lisp/ox-rss.el" :fetcher url))

```

By default upgrades are managed through file hashes, so if the content changed, `quelpa` will upgrade the package. Existing version numbers are retained. `quelpa` uses a version suffix that still allows the original version to have priority. So if you should install a package from another source with the same version it will be preferred.

To keep the original version unmodified use the parameter `:version original`. For example:

```cl
(quelpa '(queue :url "http://www.dr-qubit.org/download.php?file=predictive/queue.el" :fetcher url :version original))
```

### Additional options
#### Inhibit MELPA updates on init

Upon initialization `quelpa` usually updates the MELPA git repo (stored in `quelpa-build-dir`/`package-build`) which ensures you always have the latest recipes from MELPA available. This causes as small delay and some people don't like that (presumably people that do not use or know `emacs --daemon` and `emacsclient`).

You can disable these updates by setting `quelpa-update-melpa-p` to `nil` before requiring `quelpa`:

```cl
(setq quelpa-update-melpa-p nil)
```

### Windows Instructions

On Windows there are some caveats so the procedure to make Emacs work with `quelpa` is outlined below. You can either use the native Windows build from GNU or the Cygwin port. If you'd like to have a complete *nix environment on your Windows machine then the Cygwin version is to be preferred.

The Cygwin port is also easier to install as there are less manual steps necessary.

#### Cygwin

##### Install Cygwin #####

Download either the 64-bit or 32-bit setup file from <http://cygwin.com/install.html>. If your Windows version is 64-bit then make sure to use the 64-bit installer to avoid some problems that only happen with the 32-bit version.

It is usually better to install Cygwin just for the current user, not system-wide:

- Open the location where you have downloaded the setup executable in Explorer
- Press shift and right-click -> open command prompt here

Run for example:

    setup-x86.exe --no-admin

Just leave the default packages selected and finish the installer

##### Install a sane package manager #####

Install apt-cyg from https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg:

Open the Cygwin terminal and execute:

    lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
    install apt-cyg /bin

##### Install Emacs #####

Then install Emacs like this:

    apt-cyg install wget git emacs-w32 emacs-el

This will take quite a while...

###### Fix issue on 32-bit Cygwin ######

Using the 32-bit version of Cygwin I've got weird vfork errors and had to do a *rebase* (see http://cygwin.wikia.com/wiki/Rebaseall):

- Close the Cygwin terminal
- Start/Run: "C:\cygwin\bin\dash.exe" (adapt the path to your Cygwin install)
- Run: `/bin/rebaseall -v`
- Close dash

##### Enjoy #####

So then everything should work with `quelpa`. Open the Cygwin terminal, install your init file and enjoy Emacs on Windows (even `emacs --daemon` works with the Cygwin build)

#### Native

##### Emacs

Download and unpack Emacs from <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/> (for example to `c:\emacs`)

Some libraries are missing for SSL to work with Emacs so you will have to download the gnutls build from sourceforge: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/>

Copy all .dll files from the gnutls archive to the `c:\emacs\bin` folder.

Add `c:\emacs\bin` to the Windows `PATH` environment variable.

##### Git

Install Git from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>. **Make sure to choose these options in the installer**:

    Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt

and on the next dialog select one of the options with:

    Checkout as-is  ...

If you choose `Checkout Windows-style ...` then `quelpa` will not work correctly.

##### Tar

`tar` is needed by `quelpa` to build the `elpa` packages and has to be installed additionally.

Download MinGW from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download> and start the installer.

When you can choose the packages that should get installed go to `All Packages` -> `MSYS Base System` and mark `msys-tar` (bin) for installation. Then apply the changes.

Now copy `tar`, `msys-1.0.dll`, `msys-regex-1.dll`, `msys-intl-8.dll`, `msys-iconv-2.dll` from `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin` to `c:\emacs\bin`

Then Emacs should work with `quelpa`.

## Why "quelpa"?

The german word `Quelle` means `spring` (as in: water source) but also `source`. `source code` is translated to `Quellcode`. `ELPA` is the abbreviation for Emacs Lisp Package Archive. You get the idea.
